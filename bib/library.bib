The equation is r = (1 –/A)–2, whereA is a parameter relating to the packing geometry of the filler, which is similar to the parameter 0 in Maron-Pierce's equation. In the equation r is defined as the ratio of the viscosity of the filledsystem to that of the medium at the same shear stress not the shear rate. The applicability of the equation is above the shear stress about 104 dyne/cm2. The equation has a simple form and is considered to have a practical utility for filled-polymer melt systems.},

abstract = {In this work a population balance based kinetic model for the action of exoglucanase has been developed. A new mechanism for hydrolysis of cellulose by exoglucanase is proposed in which a bond breakage is a function of position in the chain as well as the susceptibility to enzymatic attack. Having developed the model for the action of endoglucanase in part I of this work, here a mechanistic model for the action of exoglucanase and then a holistic model considering all the major steps involved in enzymatic hydrolysis has been proposed. Having established and validated the models for the action of endo- and exoglucanase, a universal model for the cellulose hydrolysis at the surface and inside the particle have been developed. For the unknown parameters in the universal models, an experimental procedure to find the parameters in the holistic model has been proposed. It is believed that the universal kinetic model can be applied to almost any cellulose-cellulase system and once parameters for different systems are available, due to characteristic nature of the model, it would be possible to optimise the system under different conditions. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {A new strategy for controlling substrate feed in the exponential growth phase of aerated fed-batch fermentations is presented. The challenge in this phase is typically to maximize specific growth rate while avoiding the accumulation of overflow metabolites which can occur at high substrate feed rates. In the new strategy, regular perturbations to the feed rate are applied and the proximity to overflow metabolism is continuously assessed from the frequency spectrum of the dissolved oxygen signal. The power spectral density for the frequency of the external perturbations is used as a control variable in a controller to regulate the substrate feed. The strategy was implemented in an industrial pilot scale fermentation set up and calibrated and verified using an amylase producing Bacillus licheniformis strain. It was shown that a higher biomass yield could be obtained without excessive accumulation of harmful overflow metabolites. The general applicability of the strategy was further demonstrated by implementing the controller in another process using a Bacillus licheniformis strain currently used in industrial production processes. In addition, in this case a higher growth rate and decreased accumulation of overflow metabolites in the exponential growth phase was achieved in comparison to the reference controller. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

In addition, a Liquefaction plus Simultaneous Saccharification and co-Fermentation (L+SScF) was performed to compare the fermentability of the resulting pretreated biomass. After the 6-h liquefaction step using the Cellic CTec2 enzyme from Novozyme and 10\% DW pretreated biomass, the total sugar concentration in the slurry was 47. g/L and 51. g/L for the two conditions respectively. Enzymatic hydrolysis continued during fermentation using an ethanologenic derivative of Escherichia coli KO11. The sugars were completely consumed in 96. h with product yields of 0.217 and 0.243. g ethanol/g DW biomass for each condition, respectively. These yields are equivalent to 275 and 304.

@article{Trajano2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass benefits from lignin removal, relocation, and/or modification during hydrothermal pretreatment. Phase transition, depolymerization/repolymerization, and solubility effects may all influence these lignin changes. To better understand how lignin is altered, Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides wood samples and cellulolytic enzyme lignin (CEL) isolated from P. trichocarpa x P. deltoides were subjected to batch and flowthrough pretreatments. The residual solids and liquid hydrolysate were characterized by gel permeation chromatography, heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR, compositional analysis, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Changes in the structure of the solids recovered after the pretreatment of CEL and the production of aromatic monomers point strongly to depolymerization and condensation being primary mechanisms for lignin extraction and redeposition. The differences in lignin removal and phenolic compound production from native P. trichocarpa x P. deltoides and CEL suggested that lignin-carbohydrate interactions increased lignin extraction and the extractability of syringyl groups relative to guaiacyl groups. CONCLUSIONS: These insights into delignification during hydrothermal pretreatment point to desirable pretreatment strategies and plant modifications. Because depolymerization followed by repolymerization appears to be the dominant mode of lignin modification, limiting the residence time of depolymerized lignin moieties in the bulk liquid phase should reduce lignin content in pretreated biomass. In addition, the increase in lignin removal in the presence of polysaccharides suggests that increasing lignin-carbohydrate cross-links in biomass would increase delignification during pretreatment.},

abstract = {A quantitative description of dynamical systems requires the estimation of uncertain kinetic parameters and an analysis of their precision. A method frequently used to describe the confidence intervals of estimated parameters is based on the Fisher-Information-Matrix. The application of this traditional method has two important shortcomings: (i) it gives only lower bounds for the variance of a parameter if the solution of the underlying model equations is non-linear in parameters. (ii) The resulting confidence interval is symmetric with respect to the estimated parameter. Here, we show that by applying the bootstrap method a better approximation of (possibly) asymmetric confidence intervals for parameters could be obtained. In contrast to previous applications devoted to non-parametric problems, a dynamical model describing a bio-chemical network is used to evaluate the method.},

abstract = {This paper describes a systematic sensitivity analysis of optimal operation conducted on an activated sludge process model based on the test-bed benchmark simulation model no. 1 (BSM1) and the activated sludge model no. 1 (ASM1). The objective is to search for a control structure that leads to optimal economic operation, while promptly rejecting disturbances at lower layers in the control hierarchy avoiding thus violation of the more important regulation constraints on effluent discharge. We start by optimizing a steady-state nonlinear model of the process. Here, a new steady-state secondary settler mathematical model is developed based on the theory of partial differential equations applied to the conservation law with discontinuous fluxes. The resulting active constraints must be chosen as economic controlled variables. These are the effluent ammonia from the bioreaction section and the final effluent total suspended solids at their respective upper limits, in addition to the internal recycle flow rate at its lower bound. The remaining degrees of freedom need to be fulfilled, and we use several local (linear) sensitivity methods to find a set of unconstrained controlled variables that minimizes the loss between actual and optimal operation; particularly we choose to control linear combinations of readily available measurements so to minimize the effect of disturbances and implementation errors on the optimal static performance of the plant. It is expected that the proposed methodology and results obtained therein can be used in practice as general rules-of-thumb to be tested in actual wastewater treatment plants of the kind discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {Recently a model was introduced to interpret the respirometric (OUR) -titrimetric (Hp) data obtained from aerobic oxidation of different carbon sources in view of calibration of Activated Sludge Model No.1 (ASM1). The model requires, among others, the carbon dioxide transfer rate (CTR) to be relatively constant during aerobic experiments. As CTR is an inherently nonlinear process, this assumption may not hold for certain experimental conditions. Hence, we extended the model to describe the nonlinear CTR behavior. A simple calibration procedure of the CO2 model was developed only using titrimetric data. The identifiable parameter subset of this model when using titrimetric data only contained the first equilibrium constant of the CO2 dissociation, p K1, the initial aqueous CO2 concentration, CTinit and the nitrogen content of biomass, iNBM. The extended model was then successfully applied to interpret typical data obtained from respirometric-titrimetric measurements with a nonlinear CO2 stripping process. The parameter estimation results using titrimetric data were consistent with the results estimated using respirometric data (OUR) alone or combined OUR and Hp data, thereby supporting the validity of the dynamic CO2 model and its calibration approach. The increased range of applicability and accurate utilization of the titrimetric data are expected to contribute particularly to the improvement of calibration of ASM models using batch experiments. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Reliable production of biofuels and specifically bioethanol has attracted a significant amount of research recently. Within this context, this study deals with dynamic simulation of bioethanol production processes and in particular aims at developing a mathematical model for describing simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) of C6 and C5 sugars. The model is constructed by combining existing mathematical models for enzymatic hydrolysis and co-fermentation. An inhibition of ethanol on cellulose conversion is introduced in order to increase the reliability. The mathematical model for the SSCF is verified by comparing the model predictions with experimental data obtained from the ethanol production based on kraft paper mill sludge. When fitting the model to the data, only the yield coefficients for glucose and xylose metabolism were fine-tuned, which were found to be 0.43 g·g -1 (ethanol/glucose) and 0.35 g·g-1 (ethanol/xylose) respectively. These promising validation results encourage further model application to evaluate different process configurations for lignocellulosic bioethanol technology. © 2011 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).},

Much of the growth in energy consumption occurs in countries outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),2 known as non-OECD, where demand is driven by strong, long-term economic growth. Energy use in non-OECD countries increases by 90 percent; in OECD countries, the increase is 17 percent.

abstract = {Pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of the South American straw material Paja Brava were investigated. Suitable process conditions for an SO 2-catalyzed steam pretreatment of the material were determined and assessed by enzymatic digestibility of obtained fiber slurries for 72h at a water insoluble solids (WIS) content of 2\%. The best pretreatment conditions obtained (200°C, 5min holding time and 2.5\% SO 2) gave an overall glucose yield following enzymatic hydrolysis of more than 90\%, and a xylose yield of about 70\%. Simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation of glucose and xylose (SSCF) of the pretreated material using the xylose-fermenting strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae TMB3400 was examined at WIS contents between 5\% and 10\%. In agreement with previous studies on other materials, the overall ethanol yield and also the xylose conversion decreased somewhat with increasing WIS content in the SSCF. In batch SSCF, the xylose conversion obtained was almost 100\% at 5\% WIS content, but decreased to 69\% at 10\% WIS. The highest ethanol concentration obtained for a WIS content of 10\% was about 40g/L, corresponding to a yield of 0.41g/g in a fed-batch SSCF. The Paja Brava material has previously been found difficult to hydrolyze in a dilute-acid process. However, the SSCF results obtained here show that similar sugar yields and fermentation performance can be expected from Paja Brava as from materials such as wheat straw, corn stover or sugarcane bagasse. © 2010 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.},

abstract = {Because of its high content of cellulose, wheat straw is a good raw material for ethanol production. For the bioconversion of lignocellulosic materials to ethanol, pretreatment of the material prior to enzymatic hydrolysis is essential to obtain high overall yields of sugar and ethanol. Here, an experimental apparatus has been designed to investigate the effect of pretreatment of dry and wet wheat straw using supercritical carbon dioxide alone and the combination of supercritical CO2+steam by varying the temperature (160-200??C) and the residence time (10, 30, 60 or 70min). Supercritical CO2 was used as a powerful solvent for separation of cellulose from the other contents of wheat straw. The pretreatment of dry wheat straw by supercritical CO2 alone at 190??C and 30min resulted in the best overall yield for sugar (1kg wheat straw yielded 149.1g sugar). The pretreatment of wheat straw that impregnated with water by supercritical CO2 at 185??C and 30min resulted in the best overall yield for sugar (208.4gkg-1). The pretreatment of dry wheat straw by steam explosion and supercritical CO2 at steam temperature and retention time of 200??C and 15min and supercritical CO2 conditions of 12MPa, 190??C and 60min, resulted in the best overall yield for sugar (234.6gkg-1). ?? 2010 IAgrE.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bioethanol produced from the lignocellulosic fractions of sugar cane (bagasse and leaves), i.e. second generation (2G) bioethanol, has a promising market potential as an automotive fuel; however, the process is still under investigation on pilot/demonstration scale. From a process perspective, improvements in plant design can lower the production cost, providing better profitability and competitiveness if the conversion of the whole sugar cane is considered. Simulations have been performed with AspenPlus to investigate how process integration can affect the minimum ethanol selling price of this 2G process (MESP-2G), as well as improve the plant energy efficiency. This is achieved by integrating the well-established sucrose-to-bioethanol process with the enzymatic process for lignocellulosic materials. Bagasse and leaves were steam pretreated using H3PO4 as catalyst and separately hydrolysed and fermented.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The addition of a steam dryer, doubling of the enzyme dosage in enzymatic hydrolysis, including leaves as raw material in the 2G process, heat integration and the use of more energy-efficient equipment led to a 37 \% reduction in MESP-2G compared to the Base case. Modelling showed that the MESP for 2G ethanol was 0.97 US\$/L, while in the future it could be reduced to 0.78 US\$/L. In this case the overall production cost of 1G + 2G ethanol would be about 0.40 US\$/L with an output of 102 L/ton dry sugar cane including 50 \% leaves. Sensitivity analysis of the future scenario showed that a 50 \% decrease in the cost of enzymes, electricity or leaves would lower the MESP-2G by about 20\%, 10\% and 4.5\%, respectively.\backslash n\backslash nCONCLUSIONS: According to the simulations, the production of 2G bioethanol from sugar cane bagasse and leaves in Brazil is already competitive (without subsidies) with 1G starch-based bioethanol production in Europe. Moreover 2G bioethanol could be produced at a lower cost if subsidies were used to compensate for the opportunity cost from the sale of excess electricity and if the cost of enzymes continues to fall.},

abstract = {The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fuel ethanol typically involves a disruptive pretreatment process followed by enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the cellulose and hemicellulose components to fermentable sugars. Attempts to improve process economics include protein engineering of cellulases, xylanases and related hydrolases to improve their specific activity or stability. However, it is recognized that enzyme performance is reduced during lignocellulose hydrolysis by interaction with lignin or lignin-carbohydrate complex (LCC), so the selection or engineering of enzymes with reduced lignin interaction offers an alternative means of enzyme improvement. This study examines the inhibition of seven cellulase preparations, three xylanase preparations and a beta-glucosidase preparation by two purified, particulate lignin preparations derived from softwood using an organosolv pretreatment process followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. The two lignin preparations had similar particle sizes and surface areas but differed significantly in other physical properties and in their chemical compositions determined by a 2D correlation HSQC NMR technique and quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy. The various cellulases differed by up to 3.5-fold in their inhibition by lignin, while the xylanases showed less variability (< or = 1.7-fold). Of all the enzymes tested, beta-glucosidase was least affected by lignin.},

abstract = {Currently, over 80\% of the energy used by mankind comes from fossil fuels. Harnessing coal, oil and gas, the energy resources contained in the store of our spaceship, Earth, has prompted a dramatic expansion in energy use and a substantial improvement in the quality of life of billions of individuals in some regions of the world. Powering our civilization with fossil fuels has been very convenient, but now we know that it entails severe consequences. We treat fossil fuels as a resource that anyone anywhere can extract and use in any fashion, and Earth's atmosphere, soil and oceans as a dump for their waste products, including more than 30 Gt/y of carbon dioxide. At present, environmental legacy rather than consistence of exploitable reserves, is the most dramatic problem posed by the relentless increase of fossil fuel global demand. Harmful effects on the environment and human health, usually not incorporated into the pricing of fossil fuels, include immediate and short-term impacts related to their discovery, extraction, transportation, distribution, and burning as well as climate change that are spread over time to future generations or over space to the entire planet. In this essay, several aspects of the fossil fuel legacy are discussed, such as alteration of the carbon cycle, carbon dioxide rise and its measurement, greenhouse effect, anthropogenic climate change, air pollution and human health, geoengineering proposals, land and water degradation, economic problems, indirect effects on the society, and the urgent need of regulatory efforts and related actions to promote a gradual transition out of the fossil fuel era. While manufacturing sustainable solar fuels appears to be a longer-time perspective, alternatives energy sources already exist that have the potential to replace fossil fuels as feedstocks for electricity production.},

abstract = {Wheat straw is an abundant agricultural residue which can be used as a raw material for bioethanol production. Due to the high xylan content in wheat straw, fermentation of both xylose and glucose is crucial to meet desired overall yields of ethanol. In the present work a recombinant xylose fermenting strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TMB3400, cultivated aerobically on wheat straw hydrolysate, was used in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of steam pretreated wheat straw. The influence of fermentation strategy and temperature was studied in relation to xylose consumption, ethanol formation and by-product formation. In addition, model SSF experiments were made to further investigate the influence of temperature on xylose fermentation and by-product formation. In particular for SSF at the highest value of fibre content tested (9\% water insoluble substance, WIS), it was found that a fed-batch strategy was clearly superior to the batch process in terms of ethanol yield, where the fed-batch gave 71\% of the theoretical yield (based on all available sugars) in comparison to merely 59\% for the batch. Higher ethanol yields, close to 80\%, were obtained at a WIS-content of 7\%. Xylose fermentation significantly contributed to the overall ethanol yields. The choice of temperature in the range 30-37 °C was found to be important, especially at higher contents of water insoluble solids (WIS). The optimum temperature was found to be 34 °C for the raw material and yeast strain studied. Model SSF experiments with defined medium showed strong temperature effects on the xylose uptake rate and xylitol yield. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Biofuel production from renewable sources is widely considered to be one of the most sustainable alternatives to petroleum sourced fuels and a viable means for environmental and economic sustainability. Microalgae are currently being promoted as an ideal third generation biofuel feedstock because of their rapid growth rate, CO 2 fixation ability and high production capacity of lipids; they also do not compete with food or feed crops, and can be produced on nonarable land. Microalgae have broad bioenergy potential as they can be used to produce liquid transportation and heating fuels, such as biodiesel and bioethanol. In this review we present an overview about microalgae use for biodiesel and bioethanol production, including their cultivation, harvesting, and processing. The most used microalgal species for these purposes as well as the main microalgal cultivation systems (photobioreactors and open ponds) will also be discussed.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to perform a comprehensive enzyme kinetics analysis in view of validating and consolidating a semimechanistic kinetic model consisting of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions for enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass proposed by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Kadam et al., Biotechnol Prog 20(3):698-705, 2004) and its variations proposed in this work. A number of dedicated experiments were carried out under a range of initial conditions (Avicel® versus pretreated barley straw as substrate, different enzyme loadings and different product inhibitors such as glucose, cellobiose and xylose) to test the hydrolysis and product inhibition mechanisms of the model. A nonlinear least squares method was used to identify the model and estimate kinetic parameters based on the experimental data. The suitable mathematical model for industrial application was selected among the proposed models based on statistical information (weighted sum of square errors). The analysis showed that transglycosylation plays a key role at high glucose levels. It also showed that the values of parameters depend on the selected experimental data used for parameter estimation. Therefore, the parameter values are not universal and should be used with caution. The model proposed by Kadam et al. (Biotechnol Prog 20(3):698-705, 2004) failed to predict the hydrolysis phenomena at high glucose levels, but when combined with transglycosylation reaction(s), the prediction of cellulose hydrolysis behaviour over a broad range of substrate concentrations (50-150 g/L) and enzyme loadings (15.8-31.6 and 1-5.9 mg protein/g cellulose for Celluclast and Novozyme 188, respectively) was possible. This is the first study introducing transglycosylation into the semimechanistic model. As long as these type of models are used within the boundary of their validity (substrate type, enzyme source and substrate concentration), they can support process design and technology improvement efforts at pilot and full-scale studies.},

abstract = {Dried distillers' grains with solubles (DDGS), a co-product of corn ethanol production, was investigated as a feedstock for additional ethanol production. DDGS was pretreated with liquid hot-water (LHW) and ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX) processes. Cellulose was readily converted to glucose from both LHW and AFEX treated DDGS using a mixture of commercial cellulase and beta-glucosidase; however, these enzymes were ineffective at saccharifying the xylan present in the pretreated DDGS. Several commercial enzyme preparations were evaluated in combination with cellulase to saccharify pretreated DDGS xylan and it was found that adding commercial grade (e.g. impure) pectinase and feruloyl esterase (FAE) preparations were effective at releasing arabinose and xylose. The response of sugar yields for pretreated AFEX and LHW DDGS (6wt\%/solids) were determined for different enzyme loadings of FAE and pectinase and modeled as a response surfaces. Arabinose and xylose yields rose with increasing FAE and pectinase enzyme dosages for both pretreated materials. When hydrolyzed at 20wt\%/solids with the same blend of commercial enzymes, the yields were 278 and 261g sugars (i.e. total of arabinose, xylose, and glucose) per kg of DDGS (dry basis, db) for AFEX and LHW pretreated DDGS, respectively. The pretreated DDGS's were also evaluated for fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 15wt\%/solids. Pretreated DDGS were readily fermented and were converted to ethanol at 89-90\% efficiency based upon total glucans; S. cerevisiae does not ferment arabinose or xylose.},

Thermal inactivation at 50 °C, as shown by the loss of 50\% of enzyme activity over 4 days in the absence of ethanol, was more severe than at 37 °C, where only 25\% of enzyme activity was lost. In addition, at 50 °C ethanol more strongly influenced enzyme stability. Enzyme activity was moderately stabilized between ethanol concentrations of 0 and 40 g/L, but ethanol concentrations above 40 g/L accelerated enzyme inactivation, leading to 75\% loss of enzymatic activity in 80 g/L ethanol after 4 days. At 37 °C, ethanol did not show a strong effect on the rate of enzyme inactivation. Inhibition of cellulase activity by ethanol, measured at both temperatures, was relatively similar, with the relative rate of hydrolysis inhibited 50\% at ethanol concentrations of 56.4 and 58.7 g/L at 50 and 37 °C, respectively. A mathematical model was developed to test whether the measured phenomena were sufficient to quantitatively describe system behavior and was found to have good predictive capability at initial Avicel concentrations of 20 and 50 g/L.},

It is shown that while the terminal price is independent of both GDP growth and the price elasticity of energy demand, it is dependent on the world real interest rate and the total life-time stock of oil resources, as well as on the marginal extraction and scarcity cost parameters. The theoretical predictions of this model are evaluated using data on the cost of extraction, cumulative production, and proven reserves. The predicted terminal prices seem sensible for a range of parameters and variables, as illustrated by the sensitivity analysis. Using the terminal price of oil, we calculate the time to depletion, and determine the extraction and price profiles over the life-time of the resource. The extraction profiles generated seem to be in line with the actual production and the predicted prices are generally in line with those currently observed.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates the usefulness of global sensitivity analysis in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) design to prioritize sources of uncertainty and quantify their impact on performance criteria. The study, which is performed with the Benchmark Simulation Model no. 1 plant design, complements a previous paper on input uncertainty characterisation and propagation (Sin et al., 2009). A sampling-based sensitivity analysis is conducted to compute standardized regression coefficients. It was found that this method is able to decompose satisfactorily the variance of plant performance criteria (with R2 > 0.9) for effluent concentrations, sludge production and energy demand. This high extent of linearity means that the plant performance criteria can be described as linear functions of the model inputs under the defined plant conditions. In effect, the system of coupled ordinary differential equations can be replaced by multivariate linear models, which can be used as surrogate models. The importance ranking based on the sensitivity measures demonstrates that the most influential factors involve ash content and influent inert particulate COD among others, largely responsible for the uncertainty in predicting sludge production and effluent ammonium concentration. While these results were in agreement with process knowledge, the added value is that the global sensitivity methods can quantify the contribution of the variance of significant parameters, e.g., ash content explains 70\% of the variance in sludge production. Further the importance of formulating appropriate sensitivity analysis scenarios that match the purpose of the model application needs to be highlighted. Overall, the global sensitivity analysis proved a powerful tool for explaining and quantifying uncertainties as well as providing insight into devising useful ways for reducing uncertainties in the plant performance. This information can help engineers design robust WWTP plants. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Luff2001,
abstract = {Three "easy-to-use solvers" are presented for the approximation of pH and the concentrations of protolytic species in marine aqueous systems. The first one is based on the conservation of alkalinity, the second one describes the progress (advancement) of a chemical reaction towards its state of equilibrium and the third one is based on the conservation of the charges in the system (charge balance). They are developed for steady state or non-steady state modelling, but they are also useful for pH calculations from measured data sets. To demonstrate their numerical stability over a wide range of pH the solvers are tested with random input values. Internal consistency is checked by mass and charge conservation and by comparing the results of each solver. In closed systems, equilibrium calculations lead to identical pH values and species concentrations, as expected. The three approaches are also tested in a non-steady-state transport-reaction model that simulates early diagenesis in oxic deep-sea sediments as well as in reactive sediments from the deep Arabian Sea. In the model, dissolved carbonate species are either transported as individual species (CO2, HCO3, CO3) or as summed variables (TCO2, alkalinity). In the first case, the species are transported according to their individual molecular diffusion coefficients and concentration gradients. In the second case, protolytic species are transported along the gradient of summed concentrations using weighted average diffusion coefficients. The advancement approach is coupled with transport of the individual species, whereas the alkalinity conservation and the charge balance approaches are applied to transport of summed variables. The model results show that the approaches lead to non-negligible differences in the species distribution and the pH. With intensive calcium carbonate dissolution, the thermodynamically-controlled dissolution rates dominate the system: in this case, the differences in the species distribution between the three solvers and the two transport schemes can be neglected, but strong differences in the calculated fluxes between sediment and bottom water can be observed. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The formation of pseudo-lignin by the combination of carbohydrate and lignin degradation products has been proposed to be responsible for the increased Klason lignin content in biomass pretreated under acidic conditions. Direct evidence for the presence of pseudo-lignin has never been presented. The formation of additional lignin-like material may be detrimental to enzymatic hydrolysis due to the non-productive binding of enzymes with lignin. To investigate the chemistry of pseudo-lignin formation, dilute acid pretreatments were performed on delignified hybrid poplar biomass under conditions of varying severity. The results show a progressive increase in the Klason lignin content of the acid pretreated material with increasing pretreatment severity. NMR and FT-IR spectroscopic characterization shows the development of aliphatic, unsaturated and carbonyl carbon functionalities in the samples pretreated at higher severities. Given the very low Klason lignin content of the starting material, acid catalyzed dehydration of carbohydrates is responsible for the formation of pseudo-lignin.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pretreatment is an essential step in the enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass and subsequent production of bioethanol. Recent results indicate that only a mild pretreatment is necessary in an industrial, economically feasible system. The Integrated Biomass Utilisation System hydrothermal pretreatment process has previously been shown to be effective in preparing wheat straw for these processes without the application of additional chemicals. In the current work, the effect of the pretreatment on the straw cell-wall matrix and its components are characterised microscopically (atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) and spectroscopically (attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) in order to understand this increase in digestibility. RESULTS: The hydrothermal pretreatment does not degrade the fibrillar structure of cellulose but causes profound lignin re-localisation. Results from the current work indicate that wax has been removed and hemicellulose has been partially removed. Similar changes were found in wheat straw pretreated by steam explosion. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that hydrothermal pretreatment increases the digestibility by increasing the accessibility of the cellulose through a re-localisation of lignin and a partial removal of hemicellulose, rather than by disruption of the cell wall.},

abstract = {New transportation fuels are badly needed to reduce our heavy dependence on imported oil and to reduce the release of greenhouse gases that cause global climate change; cellulosic biomass is the only inexpensive resource that can be used for sustainable production of the large volumes of liquid fuels that our transportation sector has historically favored. Furthermore, biological conversion of cellulosic biomass can take advantage of the power of biotechnology to take huge strides toward making biofuels cost competitive. Ethanol production is particularly well suited to marrying this combination of need, resource, and technology. In fact, major advances have already been realized to competitively position cellulosic ethanol with corn ethanol. However, although biotechno logy presents important opportunities to achieve very low costs, pretreatment of naturally resistant cellulosic mate rials is essential if we are to achieve high yields from biological operations; this operation is projected to be the single, most expensive processing step, representing about 20\% of the total cost. In addition, pretreatment has pervasive impacts on all other major operations in the overall conversion scheme from choice of feedstock through to size reduction, hydrolysis, and fermentation, and on to product recovery, residue processing, and co-product potential. A number of different pretreatments involving biological, chemical, physical, and thermal approaches have been investigated over the years, but only those that employ chemicals currently offer the high yields and low costs vital to economic success. Among the most promising are pretreatments using dilute acid, sulfur dioxide, near-neutral pH control, ammonia expansion, aqueous ammonia, and lime, with signifi cant differences among the sugar-release patterns. Although projected costs for these options are similar when applied to corn stover, a key need now is to dramatically improve our knowledge of these systems with the goal of advancing pretreatment to substantially reduce costs and to accelerate commercial applications.},

In this work, the best operational conditions for steam-explosion pretreatment of wheat straw for ethanol production by a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process were studied, using diluted acid [H2SO4 0.9\% (w/w)] and water as preimpregnation agents. Acid- or water-impregnated biomass was steam-exploded at different temperatures (160-200 degrees C) and residence times (5, 10, and 20 min). Composition of solid and filtrate obtained after pretreatment, enzymatic digestibility and ethanol production of pretreated wheat straw at different experimental conditions was analyzed. The best pretreatment conditions to obtain high conversion yield to ethanol (approx 80\% of theoretical) of cellulose-rich residue after steam-explosion were 190 degrees C and 10 min or 200 degrees C and 5 min, in acid-impregnated straw. However, 180 degrees C for 10 min in acid-impregnated biomass provided the highest ethanol yield referred to raw material (140 L/t wheat straw), and sugars recovery yield in the filtrate (300 g/kg wheat straw).},

Input-output data from a nonlinear, first principles simulation model of the pH neutralisation process are used for subspace-based identification of a black-box Wiener-type model. The proposed nonlinear subspace identification method has the advantage of delivering a Wiener model in a format which is suitable for its use in a standard linear-model-based predictive control scheme. The identified Wiener model is used as the internal model in a model predictive controller (MPC) which is used to control the nonlinear white-box simulation model. To account for the unmeasurable disturbance, a nonlinear observer is proposed. The performance of the Wiener model predictive control (WMPC) is compared with that of a linear MPC, and with a more traditional feedback control, namely a PID control. Simulation results show that the WMPC outperforms the linear MPC and the PID controllers.},

Consequently, corn demand increased dramatically and prices tripled. This created a strong positive correlation between petroleum, corn, and food prices resulting in an outcry from U.S. consumers and livestock producers, and food riots in several developing countries.Other factors contributed to higher grain and food prices. Economic growth, especially in Asia, and a weaker U.S. dollar encouraged U.S. grain exports. Investors shifted funds into the commodity's future markets. Higher fuel costs for food processing and transportation put upward pressure on retail food prices.From mid-2008 to mid-2009, petroleum prices fell, the U.S. dollar strengthened, and the world economy entered a serious recession with high unemployment, housing market foreclosures, collapse of the stock market, reduced global trade, and a decline in durable goods and food purchases. Agricultural commodity prices declined about 50\%.Biotechnology has had modest impacts on the biofuel sector. Seed corn with traits that help control insects and weeds has been widely adopted by U.S. farmers.

Single-substrate kinetics indicate that the specific growth rate of the yeast and the specific ethanol productivity on glucose as the substrate was greater than on xylose as a substrate. Ethanol yields from glucose and xylose fermentation were typically 95 and 80\% of the theoretical yield, respectively. The effect of ethanol inhibition is more pronounced for xylose fermentation than for glucose fermentation. Studies on glucose-xylose mixtures indicate that the recombinant yeast co-ferments glucose and xylose. Fermentation of a 52.8 g/L glucose and 56.3 g/L xylose mixture gave an ethanol concentration of 47.9 g/L after 36 h. Based on a theoretical yield of 0.51 g ethanol/g sugars, the ethanol yield from this experiment (for data up to 24 h) was calculated to be 0.46 g ethanol/g sugar or 90\% of the theoretical yield. The specific growth rate of the yeast on glucose-xylose mixtures was found to lie between the specific growth rate on glucose and the specific growth rate on xylose. Kinetic studies were used to develop a fermentation model incorporating the effects of substrate inhibition, product inhibition, and inoculum size. Good agreements were obtained between model predictions and experimental data from batch fermentation of glucose, xylose, and their mixtures.},

The notation was evaluated for developing an integrated biological, chemical (pH modeling) and physical (gas-liquid exchange) model for describing antibiotic production with Streptomyces coelicolor in batch fermentations. The model provided statistically adequate fits to all the monitored macroscopic biological, chemical and physical data of the process, except the phosphate uptake dynamics. This phosphate discrepancy is hypothesized to result from the internal storage of phosphate as polyphosphate prior to the exponential growth phase. The antibiotic production was associated with the stationary phase and its kinetics was adequately described using a modified Luedeking-Piret equation. Further, the maintenance was best described by employing a combination of Pirt and Herbert models, a result that was supported by a model-based hypothesis testing. Overall the process knowledge currently incorporated in the model is believed to be useful both for process optimization purposes and for further testing of hypotheses aiming at improving the mechanistic understanding of antibiotic production with S. coelicolor. Last but not least, the matrix notation is believed to be a promising supporting tool for efficient development and communication of complex dynamic models within a PAT framework.},

abstract = {Plantwide control system design for economic operation over a wide through range (design throughput to maximum throughput) encompassing multiple active constraint regions, is studied for the cumene process. A unique feature of the process is that it recycles the heavy side-product to extinction. A novel top-down control system synthesis approach, where the control objectives for maximum throughput operation are first obtained using steady state optimization followed by control loop pairings with highest priority to economic objectives, is applied. The control structure thus obtained is unconventional with tight active constraint control requiring 'long' level loops that maintain the reflux drum and bottom sump levels of a column using the two process fresh feeds. This structure for maximum throughput operation is adapted for economic operation at lower throughputs. Rigorous dynamic simulations show that the structure provides acceptable process regulation for large disturbances despite the long level loops over the entire throughput range. More importantly, no back-off from the active hard equipment capacity constraints also ensure that the loss in throughput from the maximum achievable is negligible. This work is amongst the first reports illustrating the application of the top-down plantwide control system design approach for superior economic performance with robust process stabilization. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this work, generalized predictive control (GPC) was applied to a pH neutralization process. The process consists of a continuous flow tubular reactor. The process stream is a water solution of acetic acid and the titrating stream is a water solution of sodium hydroxide. The aim of the control is to keep the pH value at a given set point value when the process is subjected to variations in feed flowrate. The use of polynomial autoregressive integral moving average with external input (ARIMAX) model related with pH and base flowrate was emphasized. The model parameters were determined by using Bierman and Genetic algorithms. The $\lambda$ weighting was varied in order to achieve optimal GPC performance. The efficiency of the GPC was observed by calculating the integral of the square of the error (ISE) and the integral of the absolute value of the error (IAE) from experimental results. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Steam-exploded (SE) poplar wood biomass was hydrolyzed by means of a blend of Celluclast and Novozym cellulase complexes in the presence of the inhibiting compounds produced during the preceding steam-explosion pretreatment process. The SE temperature and time conditions were 214 degrees C and 6 min, resulting in a log R(0) of 4.13. In enzymatic hydrolysis tests at 45 degrees C, the biomass loading in the bioreactor was 100 g(DW)/L (dry weight) and the enzyme-to-biomass ratio 0.06 g/g(DW). The enzyme activities for endo-glucanase, exo-glucanase, and beta-glucosidase were 5.76, 0.55, and 5.98 U/mg, respectively. The inhibiting effects of components released during SE (formic, acetic, and levulinic acids, furfural, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF), syringaldehyde, 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde, and vanillin) were studied at different concentrations in hydrolysis runs performed with rinsed SE biomass as model substrate. Acetic acid (2 g/L), furfural, 5-HMF, syringaldehyde, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and vanillin (0.5 g/L) did not significantly effect the enzyme activity, whereas formic acid (11.5 g/L) inactivated the enzymes and levulinic acid (29.0 g/L) partially affected the cellulase. Synergism and cumulative concentration effects of these compounds were not detected. SSF experiments show that untreated SE biomass during the enzymatic attack gives rise to a nonfermentable hydrolysate, which becomes fermentable when rinsed SE biomass is used. The presence of acetic acid, vanillin, and 5-HMF (0.5 g/L) in SSF of 100 g(DW) /L biomass gave rise to ethanol yields of 84.0\%, 73.5\%, and 91.0\% respectively, with respective lag phases of 42, 39, and 58 h.},

@article{Hodge2009,
abstract = {While many kinetic models have been developed for the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose, few have been extensively applied for process design, optimization, or control. High-solids operation of the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose is motivated by both its operation decreasing capital costs and increasing product concentration and hence separation costs. This work utilizes both insights obtained from experimental work and kinetic modeling to develop an optimization strategy for cellulose saccharification at insoluble solids levels greater than 15\% (w/w), where mixing in stirred tank reactors (STRs) becomes problematic. A previously developed model for batch enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose was modified to consider the effects of feeding in the context of fed-batch operation. By solving the set of model differential equations, a feeding profile was developed to maintain the insoluble solids concentration at a constant or manageable level throughout the course of the reaction. Using this approach, a stream of relatively concentrated solids (and cellulase enzymes) can be used to increase the final sugar concentration within the reactor without requiring the high initial levels of insoluble solids that would be required if the operation were performed in batch mode. Experimental application in bench-scale STRs using a feed stream of dilute acid-pretreated corn stover solids and cellulase enzymes resulted in similar cellulose conversion profiles to those achieved in batch shake-flask reactors where temperature control issues are mitigated. Final cellulose conversions reached approximately 80\% of theoretical for fed-batch STRs fed to reach a cumulative solids level of 25\% (w/w) initial insoluble solids.},

abstract = {A kinetic model fitted to enzymatic hydrolysis of Arundo donax was coupled to a fermentation kinetic model derived from simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) experiments at different temperatures for the determination of optimal temperature profile (between 36 and 45°C) using iterative dynamic programming (IDP). A sensitivity analysis of enzyme kinetic model not only facilitated model reduction in terms of number of parameters, but also enabled artifacts from parameter estimations to be identified. In separate fermentation experiments conducted at 35, 40, 45, and 50°C using ∼40 g/L background glucose in fiber-free liquid fraction of Arundo it was found that growth was possible at 40°C, but the fermentation capacity was completely lost after 12 h at 50°C. The final ethanol concentration obtained after 120 h in isothermal SSF experiments at 36, 39, 42, and 45°C were 10.6, 13.7, 14.2, and 12.5 g/L, respectively. The predicted optimal temperature profile in SSF determined by iterative dynamic programming was (i) gradual decrease from 40 to 37.5°C until 16 h, (ii) a linear increase upto 45°C until 80 h, and (iii) gradual decrease by 1°C until 120 h. Experimental results were in good agreement with the model predictions. The ethanol concentration after 72 h obtained in the optimal case was 13.6 g/L in comparison to 9.1, 12.2, 12.6, and 11.6 g/L for ISO-SSF at 36, 39, 42, and 45°C, respectively. Moreover this value was 95.8\% of the final value achieved at the end of 120 h, indicating that the process times could be significantly shortened by using non-isothermal SSF.},

Launched as an alternative for$\backslash$ndiesel in India, Jatropha has been promoted as a non-edible plant that$\backslash$ncould grow on poor soils, yield oil-rich seeds for production of$\backslash$nbio-diesel, and not compete directly with food production. Through$\backslash$ninterviews with the farmers, information was gathered regarding their$\backslash$nsocio-economic situation, the implementation and performance of their$\backslash$nJatropha plantations, and their reasons for continuing or discontinuing$\backslash$nJatropha cultivation. Results reveal that 82\% of the farmers had$\backslash$nsubstituted former cropland for their Jatropha cultivation. By 2010,$\backslash$n85\% (n = 90) of the farmers who cultivated Jatropha in 2004 had$\backslash$nstopped. Cultivating the crop did not give the economic returns the$\backslash$nfarmers anticipated, mainly due to a lack of information about the crop$\backslash$nand its maintenance during cultivation and due to water scarcity. A$\backslash$nmajority of the farmers irrigated and applied fertilizer, and even$\backslash$npesticides. Many problems experienced by the farmers were due to limited$\backslash$nknowledge about cultivating Jatropha caused by poor planning and$\backslash$nimplementation of the national Jatropha program. Extension services,$\backslash$nsubsidies, and other support were not provided as promised. The farmers$\backslash$nwho continued cultivation had means of income other than Jatropha and$\backslash$nheld hopes of a future Jatropha market. The lack of market structures,$\backslash$nsuch as purchase agreements and buyers, as well as a low retail price$\backslash$nfor the seeds, were frequently stated as barriers to Jatropha$\backslash$ncultivation. For Jatropha biodiesel to perform well, efforts are needed$\backslash$nto improve yield levels and stability through genetic improvements and$\backslash$ndrought tolerance, as well as agriculture extension services to support$\backslash$nadoption of the crop. Government programs will -probably be more$\backslash$neffective if implementing biodiesel production is conjoined with$\backslash$nstimulating the demand for Jatropha biodiesel. To avoid food-biofuel$\backslash$ncompetition, additional measures may be needed such as land-use$\backslash$nrestrictions for Jatropha producers and taxes on biofuels or biofuel$\backslash$nfeedstocks to improve the competitiveness of the food sector compared to$\backslash$nthe bioenergy sector.

abstract = {In this study, several strategies to upgrade lignocellulosic biorefineries for production of value-added chemicals are systematically generated and evaluated with respect to economic and sustainability objectives. A superstructure-based process synthesis approach under uncertainty integrated with a sustainability assessment method is used as evaluation tool. First, an existing superstructure representing the lignocellulosic biorefinery design network is extended to include the options for catalytic conversion of bioethanol to value-added derivatives. Second, the optimization problem for process upgrade is formulated and solved for two different objective functions: i) maximization of operating profit (the techno-economic criterion); and ii) minimization of the sustainability single index ratio (the sustainability criterion). These results indicate first that there is a significant potential of improvement of operating profit for biorefineries producing bioethanol-derived chemicals (247 MM\$/a and 241 MM\$/a for diethyl ether and 1,3-butadiene, respectively). Second, the optimal designs for upgrading bioethanol (i.e. production of 1,3-butadiene and diethyl ether) performed also better with respect to sustainability compared with the petroleum-based processes. In both cases, the effects of the market price uncertainties were also analyzed by performing quantitative economic risk analysis and presented a significant risk of investment for a lignocellulosic biorefinery (12 MM\$/a and 92 MM\$/a for diethyl ether and 1,3-butadiene, respectively). The multi-product biorefinery presented a more robust and risk-aware upgrading strategy considering the uncertainties that are typical for a long-term investment horizon.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Wheat straw used for bioethanol production varies in enzymatic digestibility according to chemical structure and composition of cell walls and tissues. In this work, the two biologically different wheat straw organs, leaves and stems, are described together with the effects of hydrothermal pretreatment on chemical composition, tissue structure, enzyme adhesion and digestion. To highlight the importance of inherent cell wall characteristics and the diverse effects of mechanical disruption and biochemical degradation, separate leaves and stems were pretreated on lab-scale and their tissue structures maintained mostly intact for image analysis. Finally, samples were enzymatically hydrolysed to correlate digestibility to chemical composition, removal of polymers, tissue composition and disruption, particle size and enzyme adhesion as a result of pretreatment and wax removal. For comparison, industrially pretreated wheat straw from Inbicon A/S was included in all the experiments.RESULTS:Within the same range of pretreatment severities, industrial pretreatment resulted in most hemicellulose and epicuticular wax/cutin removal compared to lab-scale pretreated leaves and stems but also in most re-deposition of lignin on the surface. Tissues were furthermore degraded from tissues into individual cells while lab-scale pretreated samples were structurally almost intact. In both raw leaves and stems, endoglucanase and exoglucanase adhered most to parenchyma cells; after pretreatment, to epidermal cells in all the samples. Despite heavy tissue disruption, industrially pretreated samples were not as susceptible to enzymatic digestion as lab-scale pretreated leaves while lab-scale pretreated stems were the least digestible.CONCLUSIONS:Despite preferential enzyme adhesion to epidermal cells after hydrothermal pretreatment, our results suggest that the single most important factor determining wheat straw digestibility is the fraction of parenchyma cells rather than effective tissue disruption.},

abstract = {The most common procedures for characterizing the chemical components of lignocellulosic feedstocks use a two-stage sulfuric acid hydrolysis to fractionate biomass for gravimetric and instrumental analyses. The uncertainty (i.e., dispersion of values from repeated measurement) in the primary data is of general interest to those with technical or financial interests in biomass conversion technology. The composition of a homogenized corn stover feedstock (154 replicate samples in 13 batches, by 7 analysts in 2 laboratories) was measured along with a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reference sugar cane bagasse, as a control, using this laboratory's suite of laboratory analytical procedures (LAPs). The uncertainty was evaluated by the statistical analysis of these data and is reported as the standard deviation of each component measurement. Censored and uncensored versions of these data sets are reported, as evidence was found for intermittent instrumental and equipment problems. The censored data are believed to represent the "best case" results of these analyses, whereas the uncensored data show how small method changes can strongly affect the uncertainties of these empirical methods. Relative standard deviations (RSD) of 1-3\% are reported for glucan, xylan, lignin, extractives, and total component closure with the other minor components showing 4-10\% RSD. The standard deviations seen with the corn stover and NIST bagasse materials were similar, which suggests that the uncertainties reported here are due more to the analytical method used than to the specific feedstock type being analyzed.},

abstract = {Dilute acid as well as water only (hydrothermal) pretreatments often lead to a significant hemicellulose loss to soluble furans and insoluble degradation products, collectively termed as chars and/or pseudo-lignin. In order to understand the factors contributing to reducing sugar yields from pretreated biomass and the possible influence of hemicellulose derived pseudo-lignin on cellulose conversion at the moderate to low enzyme loadings necessary for favorable economics, dilute acid pretreatment of Avicel cellulose alone and mixed with beechwood xylan or xylose was performed at various severities. Following pretreatment, the solids were enzymatically hydrolyzed and characterized for chemical composition and physical properties by NMR, FT-IR, and SEM imaging. It was found that hemicelluloses (xylan) derived-pseudo-lignin was formed at even moderate severities and that these insoluble degradation products can significantly retard cellulose hydrolysis. Furthermore, although low severity (CSF \~{} 1.94) dilute acid pretreatment of a xylan-Avicel mixture hydrolyzed most of the xylan (98\%) and produced negligible amounts of pseudo-lignin, enzymatic conversion of cellulose dropped significantly (>25\%) compared to cellulose pretreated alone at the same conditions. The drop in cellulose conversion was higher than realized for cellulase inhibition by xylooligomers reported previously. Plausible mechanisms are discussed to explain the observed reductions in cellulose conversions.},

abstract = {The study focus was an examination of the hydrothermal pretreatment method applied to the lignocellulosic substrate, represented by the prairie cord grass, and comparison between different conditions based on the yield of glucose after enzymatic hydrolysis. The treatment did not involve any chemicals usage. Enzymatic hydrolysis was performed in order to examine the amount of glucose which was released from pretreated materials. The most efficient pretreatment conditions were at high temperature and relatively short reaction time (210˚C and 10 min), after which the lignocellulose structure was the most available for enzymes actions which resulted in a pretreatment conversion rate of 97\%. Temperature had a significant influence on glucose release during the hydrolysis, which was confirmed by the Michaelis-Menten and kinetic models. Kinetic models were used to fit the inhibitors and their conversion rates were related to temperature.},

abstract = {Since the United States began a programme to develop ethanol as a transportation fuel, its use has increased from 175 million gallons in 1980 to 4.9 billion gallons in 2006. Virtually all of the ethanol used for transportation has been produced from corn. During the period of fuel ethanol growth, corn farming productivity has increased dramatically, and energy use in ethanol plants has been reduced by almost by half. The majority of corn ethanol plants are powered by natural gas. However, as natural gas prices have skyrocketed over the last several years, efforts have been made to further reduce the energy used in ethanol plants or to switch from natural gas to other fuels, such as coal and wood chips. In this paper, we examine nine corn ethanol plant types\^{a}€”categorized according to the type of process fuels employed, use of combined heat and power, and production of wet distiller grains and solubles. We found that these ethanol plant types can have distinctly different energy and greenhouse gas emission effects on a full fuel-cycle basis. In particular, greenhouse gas emission impacts can vary significantly\^{a}€”from a 3\% increase if coal is the process fuel to a 52\% reduction if wood chips are used. Our results show that, in order to achieve energy and greenhouse gas emission benefits, researchers need to closely examine and differentiate among the types of plants used to produce corn ethanol so that corn ethanol production would move towards a more sustainable path.},

abstract = {Wheat straw is a potential feedstock for bioethanol production. This paper investigates tissues from whole internode sections subjected to hydrothermal pretreatment at 185°C and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis up to 144 h. Analyses revealed an increase in surface lignin as hydrolysis progressed, which could be coupled to the gradual decrease in hydrolysis rate over time. The data support the hypothesis of lignin extraction from the cell wall matrix during pretreatment and deposition as droplets upon cooling. These droplets are assumed to accumulate during enzymatic hydrolysis. Additionally, after 144 h of enzymatic hydrolysis the cortex had vanished, exposing the heavier lignified vascular tissue. Accumulation of lignin droplets and exposure of residual lignin could be part of the explanation for the decreasing hydrolysis rate. Flattening of macrofibrils after pretreatment together with more indentations on the surfaces was also observed, possibly caused by a proposed synergistic effect of cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases.},

abstract = {Wood is the most abundant biomass on Earth. Besides cellulose, the main component, wood also contains a substantial amount of hemicelluloses. For paper making purpose, cellulose is the main raw material and only a minor amount of hemicelluloses is used, thus, a great part of hemicelluloses is considered as by-product in paper making process. These hemicelluloses can be hydrolyzed into monomer sugars and then served as feed stock for bacterial fermentation for the accompanying production of value-added bio-fuels and other chemicals. Hemicellulose (xylan) can be hydrolyzed chemically or enzymatically. In chemical hydrolysis predominant applied chemicals are H2SO4 and NaOH and enzymatic hydrolysis is carried out by enzymes. Enzymatic hydrolysis occurs at mild operating conditions of temperature, pH and pressure, also it is environment friendly. Due to the complex chemical nature of xylan, its complete breakdown requires the action of a complex of several hydrolytic enzymes with diverse modes of action and specificity. This complex usually consists of the enzymes, endo-1, 4-$\beta$-xylanase, $\beta$-D-xylosidase, acetyl xylan esterase, $\alpha$-glucuronidase and arabinase. In this project two commercial enzyme mixtures, Celluclast 1.5 L and Pulpzyme HC, were used. Celluclast has mainly $\beta$-xylosidase activity while Pulpzyme has $\beta$-1, 4 xylanase activity. The experiments were carried out at the conditions of, temperature 40-60 °C, pH 5-7 and Celluclast to Pulpzyme ratio 0-100 \%. Seventeen experiments were run. The results show that pH is the most important factor, low pH (at pH 5) result in a higher yield of xylose. Temperature and Celluclast to Pulpzyme ratio are also important factors. Celluclast to Pulpzyme ratio in the range 50–70\% results high xylose yield, this can be explained by the fact that the preparation of Celluclast 1.5 L exhibits $\beta$- xylosidase activity which is responsible for debranching xylobiose and short chain xylo-oligisaccharides.},

abstract = {Controlled pH, liquid hot water pretreatment of corn stover has been optimized for enzyme digestibility with respect to processing temperature and time. This processing technology does not require the addition of chemicals such as sulfuric acid, lime, or ammonia that add cost to the process because these chemicals must be neutralized or recovered in addition to the significant expense of the chemicals themselves. Second, an optimized controlled pH, liquid hot water pretreatment process maximizes the solubilization of the hemicellulose fraction as liquid soluble oligosaccharides while minimizing the formation of monomeric sugars. The optimized conditions for controlled pH, liquid hot water pretreatment of a 16\% slurry of corn stover in water was found to be 190??C for 15 min. At the optimal conditions, 90\% of the cellulose was hydrolyzed to glucose by 15 FPU of cellulase per gram of glucan. When the resulting pretreated slurry, in undiluted form, was hydrolyzed by 11 FPU of cellulase per gram of glucan, a hydrolyzate containing 32.5 g/L glucose and 18 g/L xylose was formed. Both the xylose and the glucose in this undiluted hydrolyzate were shown to be fermented by recombinant yeast 424A(LNH-ST) to ethanol at 88\% of theoretical yield. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variations in sugar yield due to genotypic qualities of feedstock are largely undescribed for pilot-scale ethanol processing. Our objectives were to compare glucose and xylose yield (conversion and total sugar yield) from straw of five winter wheat cultivars at three enzyme loadings (2.5, 5 and 10 FPU g-1 dm pretreated straw) and to compare particle size distribution of cultivars after pilot-scale hydrothermal pretreatment. RESULTS: Significant interactions between enzyme loading and cultivars show that breeding for cultivars with high sugar yields under modest enzyme loading could be warranted. At an enzyme loading of 5 FPU g-1 dm pretreated straw, a significant difference in sugar yields of 17\% was found between the highest and lowest yielding cultivars. Sugar yield from separately hydrolyzed particle-size fractions of each cultivar showed that finer particles had 11\% to 21\% higher yields than coarse particles. The amount of coarse particles from the cultivar with lowest sugar yield was negatively correlated with sugar conversion. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that genetic differences in sugar yield and response to enzyme loading exist for wheat straw at pilot scale, depending on differences in removal of hemicellulose, accumulation of ash and particle-size distribution introduced by the pretreatment.},

Having developed the model for the action of endoglucanase in part I of this work, here a mechanistic model for the action of exoglucanase and then a holistic model considering all the major steps involved in enzymatic hydrolysis has been proposed. Having established and validated the models for the action of endo- and exoglucanase, a universal model for the cellulose hydrolysis at the surface and inside the particle have been developed. For the unknown parameters in the universal models, an experimental procedure to find the parameters in the holistic model has been proposed. It is believed that the universal kinetic model can be applied to almost any cellulose-cellulase system and once parameters for different systems are available, due to characteristic nature of the model, it would be possible to optimise the system under different conditions. ?? 2011.},

Inbicon A/S has developed the IBUS process in a large-scale process development unit. This plant features new continuous and energy-efficient technology developed for pretreatment and liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass and has now been operated and optimized for four years with promising results. In the IBUS process, biomass is converted using steam and enzymes only. The process is energy efficient due to very high dry matter content in all process steps and by integration with a power plant. Cellulose is converted to bioethanol and lignin to a high-quality solid biofuel which supply the process energy as well as a surplus of heat and power. Hemicellulose is used as feed molasses but in the future it could also be used for additional ethanol production or other valuable products. Feasibility studies of the IBUS process show that the production price for lignocellulosic bioethanol is close to the world market price for fuel ethanol. There is still room for optimization - and lignocellulosic bioethanol is most likely a commercial alternative to fossil transport fuels before 2012.},

abstract = {Typically, the enzymatic hydrolysis rate of lignocellulosic biomass is fast initially but then slows down more rapidly than can be explained by just consumption of substrate. Although several factors including enzyme inhibition, enzyme deactivation, a drop in substrate reactivity, or nonproductive binding of enzyme to lignin could be responsible for this loss of effectiveness, we recently reported evidence that xylose, xylan, and xylooligomers dramatically decrease conversion rates and yields, but clarification was still needed for the magnitude of their effect. Therefore, in this study, xylan and various xylooligomers were added to Avicel hydrolysis at low enzyme loadings and found to have a greater effect than adding equal amounts of xylose derived from these materials or when added separately. Furthermore, xylooligomers were more inhibitory than xylan or xylose in terms of a decreased initial hydrolysis rate and a lower final glucose yield even for a low concentration of 1.67 mg/ml. At a higher concentration of 12.5mg/ml, xylooligomers lowered initial hydrolysis rates of Avicel by 82\% and the final hydrolysis yield by 38\%. Mixed DP xylooligomers showed strong inhibition on cellulase enzymes but not on beta-glucosidase enzymes. By tracking the profile change of xylooligomers, a large portion of the xylooligomers was found to be hydrolyzed by Spezyme CP enzyme preparations, indicating competitive inhibition by mixed xylooligomers. A comparison among glucose sugars and xylose sugars also showed that xylooligomers were more powerful inhibitors than well-established glucose and cellobiose.},

abstract = {The natural resistance to enzymatic deconstruction exhibited by lignocellulosic materials has designated pretreatment as a key step in the biological conversion of biomass to ethanol. Hydrothermal pretreatment in pure water represents a challenging approach because it is a method with low operational costs and does not involve the use of organic solvents, difficult to handle chemicals, and "external" liquid or solid catalysts. In the present work, a systematic study has been performed to optimize the hydrothermal treatment of lignocellulosic biomass (beech wood) with the aim of maximizing the enzymatic digestibility of cellulose in the treated solids and obtaining a liquid side product that could also be utilized for the production of ethanol or valuable chemicals. Hydrothermal treatment experiments were conducted in a batch-mode, high-pressure reactor under autogeneous pressure at varying temperature (130-220 °C) and time (15-180 min) regimes, and at a liquid-to-solid ratio (LSR) of 15. The intensification of the process was expressed by the severity factor, log R(o). The major changes induced in the solid biomass were the dissolution/removal of hemicellulose to the process liquid and the partial removal and relocation of lignin on the external surface of biomass particles in the form of recondensed droplets. The above structural changes led to a 2.5-fold increase in surface area and total pore volume of the pretreated biomass solids. The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose increased from less than 7 wt\% for the parent biomass to as high as 70 wt\% for the treated solids. Maximum xylan recovery (60 wt\%) in the hydrothermal process liquid was observed at about 80 wt\% hemicellulose removal; this was accomplished by moderate treatment severities (log R(o)=3.8-4.1). At higher severities (log R(o)=4.7), xylose degradation products, mainly furfural and formic acid, were the predominant chemicals formed.},

abstract = {The role of endocellulases and endoxylanase during liquefaction and saccharification of hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw was studied. The use of a flow-loop setup with in-line magnetic resonance imaging enabled frequent measurements of viscosity at 55°C during saccharification at 6\% total solids content. Viscosity data were complemented with off-line measurements of fiber lengths and release of soluble sugars. A clear correlation between fiber attrition and a decrease in viscosity was found. Fiber lengths and viscosity dropped quickly within the first hour and then stagnated, while sugar yields increased substantially thereafter, illustrating that liquefaction and saccharification are separate mechanisms. Both endoglucanase and endoxylanase were shown to have a significant effect on viscosity during liquefaction while the addition of endoxylanase also increased sugar yield. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

abstract = {A multireaction kinetic model was developed for closed-system enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass such as corn stover. Three hydrolysis reactions were modeled, two heterogeneous reactions for cellulose breakdown to cellobiose and glucose and one homogeneous reaction for hydrolyzing cellobiose to glucose. Cellulase adsorption onto pretreated lignocellulose was modeled via a Langmuir-type isotherm. The sugar products of cellulose hydrolysis, cellobiose and glucose, as well as xylose, the dominant sugar prevalent in most hemicellulose hydrolyzates, were assumed to competitively inhibit the enzymatic hydrolysis reactions. Model parameters were estimated from experimental data generated using dilute acid pretreated corn stover as the substrate. The model performed well in predicting cellulose hydrolysis trends at experimental conditions both inside and outside the design space used for parameter estimation and can be used for in silico process optimization.},

abstract = {Commercial cellulase complexes produced by cellulolytic fungi contain enzyme activities that are capable of hydrolyzing non-cellulosic polysaccharides in biomass, primarily hemicellulose and pectins, in addition to cellulose. However, xylanase activities detected in most commercial enzyme preparations have been shown to be insufficient to completely hydrolyze xylan, resulting in high xylooligomer concentrations remaining in the hydrolysis broth. Our recent research showed that these xylooligomers are stronger inhibitors of cellulase activity than others have previously established for glucose and cellobiose, making their removal of great importance. In this study, a HPLC system that can measure xylooligomers with degrees of polymerization (DP) up to 30 was applied to assess how Spezyme CP cellulase, Novozyme 188 ??-glucosidase, Multifect xylanase, and non-commercial ??-xylosidase enzymes hydrolyze different chain length xylooligomers derived from birchwood xylan. Spezyme CP cellulase and Multifect xylanase partially hydrolyzed high DP xylooligomers to lower DP species and monomeric xylose, while ??-xylosidase showed the strongest ability to degrade both high and low DP xylooligomers. However, about 10-30\% of the higher DP xylooligomers were difficult to be breakdown by cellulase or xylanase and about 5\% of low DP xylooligomers (mainly xylobiose) proved resistant to hydrolysis by cellulase or ??-glucosidase, possibly due to low ??-xylosidase activity in these enzymes and/or the precipitation of high DP xylooligomers. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Carbohydrates and lignin make up a major portion of biomass samples. These constituents must be measured as part of a comprehensive biomass analysis, Carbohydrates can be structural or non-structural. Structural carbohydrates are bound in the matrix of the biomass, while non-structural carbohydrates can be removed using extraction or washing steps. Lignin is a complex phenolic polymer. Portions of this procedure are substantially similar to ASTM E1758-01 “Standard method for the Determination of Carbohydrates by HPLC. This procedure is suitable for samples that do not contain extractives. This procedure uses a two-step acid hydrolysis to fractionate the biomass into forms that are more easily quantified. The lignin fractionates into acid insoluble material and acid soluble material. The acid insoluble material may also include ash and protein, which must be accounted for during gravimetric analysis. The acid soluble lignin is measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy. During hydrolysis the polymeric carbohydrates are hydrolyzed into the monomeric forms, which are soluble in the hydrolysis liquid. They are then measured by HPLC. Protein may also partition into the liquid fraction. A measure of acetyl content is necessary for biomass containing hemicellulose with a xylan backbone, but not biomass containing a mannan backbone. Acetate is measured by HPLC.},

abstract = {Large environmental simulation models are usually overparameterized with respect to given sets of observations. This results in poorly identifiable or nonidentifiable model parameters. For small models, plots of sensitivity functions have proven to be useful for the analysis of parameter identifiability. For models with many parameters, however, near-linear dependence of sensitivity functions can no longer be assessed graphically. In this paper a systematic approach for tackling the parameter identifiability problem of large models based on local sensitivity analysis is presented. The calculation of two identifiability measures that are easy to handle and interpret is suggested. The first accounts for the sensitivity of model results to single parameters, and the second accounts for the degree of near-linear dependence of sensitivity functions of parameter subsets. It is shown how these measures provide identifiability diagnosis for parameter subsets, how they are able to guide the selection of identifiable parameter subsets for parameter estimation, and how they facilitate the interpretation of the correlation matrix of the parameter estimate with respect to parameter identifiability. In addition, we show how potential bias of the parameter estimates, due to a priori fixing of some of the parameters, can be analyzed. Finally, two case studies are presented in order to illustrate the suggested approach.},
