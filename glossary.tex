\chapter{Abbreviations}
Add new terms in abbreviations.tex following the code sample from that file. Inside the body text use the defined terms in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbackslash gls\{term\} prints the expanded term with the acronym inside parenthesis if the term appears for the first time:
	\gls{IBUS}
	
	\item A consecutive use of \textbackslash gls\{term\} of an already defined term will only print its acronym:
	\gls{IBUS}
\end{itemize}

The list of abbreviations is automatically populated with all terms sorted alphabetically plus links to all pages where terms are used.
